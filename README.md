This project revolves around extracting data from Pakwheels to build a robust web application. Initially, we extracted and meticulously cleaned data from the Pakwheels website, focusing on the used car market. Our data preprocessing steps included data cleaning, normalization, encoding, and feature engineering to ensure high-quality inputs for modeling. The dataset comprised over 46,000 cars, providing a comprehensive foundation for analysis. We performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns and correlations within the dataset. Following EDA, we implemented and fine-tuned six machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Gradient Boost, XGBoost, LightGBM, Decision Tree, and Lasso Regression. XGBoost emerged as the best-performing model, achieving a testing accuracy of 97%, as determined by the R-squared values. The trained XGBoost model was saved in a pickle file for seamless deployment. The innovation lies in the incorporation of a recommendation system within the web application. This feature assists users in identifying cars within their budget constraints, enhancing their overall experience. By combining accurate price predictions and personalized recommendations, our project aims to streamline the decision-making process for users navigating the dynamic landscape of used car transactions. The resulting web application is a user-friendly tool, providing valuable insights and empowering users with informed choices in the used car market.
